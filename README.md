Scrape and ??? leap dates from hip TV show quantum leap

A couple of scripts to scrape and mung the dates of every leap that occurs in Quantum Leap.

I have no figured out a way to profit from this, yet.

I did try making a flow chart of Sam's timeline, and damn that thing is a mess. I mean, not Primer messy, but still pretty bad.
